## Face-Mask-Detection
A deep learning model that detects whether a person has worn a mask or not, real-time.

#### Motivation
In the present scenario of the Covid-19 pandemic, wearing a face mask is much more important than everything to protect our lives. This face-mask detector helps you to check whether you have your protection mask on. 

This deep learning model can be extended to real-time detection using OpenCV and also as a telegram bot. The scripts for the use cases are included in the repo.

The model was built using Transfer Learning which uses ResNet-50 as its underlying architecture. I have used the pretrained weights of the ImageNet model to train the network.

The dataset consists of 3725 images with mask and 3828 images without mask with a total of 7553 images. Download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset)
